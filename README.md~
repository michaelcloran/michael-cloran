    so when the user clicks on submit the form it redirects to a form submitted page which acknowledges the submission of the form and tells the user
    that they will be redirected to the Home page in 10 seconds. It also has the ability to manually link to the home page via a link. Note that all form fields are required
    for the form to submit.

## - Testing
On Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge it is possible to test the code on different virtual devices. The screen grab below
shows the website on the IPhone SE. I have with this tool tested the website on all devices present in Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge
and got reasonably good results.I have also tested it on my Mobile and got good results<br>
    
![image](https://github.com/michaelcloran/michael-cloran/assets/107754541/b7823705-4ccd-4ee5-8305-f1cca37851f1)

- Steps to test
  Open a browser and navigate to : https://michaelcloran.github.io/michael-cloran/
  Then right click and on the context menu select Inspect and click on the icon<br>
  ![image](https://github.com/michaelcloran/michael-cloran/assets/107754541/484cf41f-25b3-409b-b294-0465e3d13437)
  <br>
  then your browser should be able to show diffent screen sizes as per mobile device as shown below
  <br>
  ![image](https://github.com/michaelcloran/michael-cloran/assets/107754541/b46bfbea-1e71-4401-a6c7-cc5ffb9d4f2c)
  <br>
All virtual devices were tested and I got reasonable results. It should be noted that the virtual devices are sometimes
buggy.

Expected
All virtual devices are with the site responsive. And the site scales well under different screen sizes.

Actual.
On the education nav link, on small screens a horizontal scroll is needed.

## Functional testing

### Navigation Links
The site was tested to ensure that all links were operational for mobile and Desktop environments.
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Navigation Link</th>
    <th>Page to load</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Home</td>
    <td>index.html</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eduation</td>
    <td>education.html</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Books</td>
    <td>books.html</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
     <td>Contact</td>
    <td>contact.html</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Form testing

The form was tested with details shown below<br>
![image](https://github.com/michaelcloran/michael-cloran/assets/107754541/bbc833d1-1896-428a-950a-7df6ec9f3cb3)

On submit the forms action page is loaded and the user is given a message and a redirect to Home page in 10 seconds message.<br>
![image](https://github.com/michaelcloran/michael-cloran/assets/107754541/8d0d0d02-5d03-4e39-86b4-a33cd056368b)

It should be noted that all fields are required for the form to submit. The form was tested for this by putting in values and leaving 
out values on other inputs fields and trying to submit. When a input is not entered and you press on submit the form does not submit
it highlights the input field and gives and gives an error message<br>

 ## Deployment
 - Version control
   This site was created using Blue Fish web developer tools where a commit would be done by logging onto the server Apache 2 local sandbox
   and opening a terminal in the root directory of the website<br>
   
     1 a git add . would be done to add files<br>
     2 a git commit -m "message"<br>
     3 a git push to push the local to remote reposotiory<br>
        
It shouild be noted that during the deployment stage and editing of the Readme. It was done through Google Chrome so I had issues with the repository being modified
from several sources so I had to once an edit of the readme was iniated and submitted a commit was done. If I wanted to submit from the local server root directory I would have to do a git pull first to
resync the files and then it is possible to commit from the local sandbox!.

  
The site was Deployed to GitHub.

This was done by logging into GitHub, then choosing a repository michael-cloran then navigating to settings on the menu
bar and then clicking on settings. Then on clicking pages on the sidebar and then on Build and deployment clicking on 
Deploy from branch and for branch choosing main and root and then clicking on save. Once this is done the website will be deployed
and after a few minutes it will be live on for instance : https://michaelcloran.github.io/michael-cloran/

## Credits

I used a CV appt online to see different colours and styles of CV : cvapp.ie CV creation from templates https://cvapp.ie/cv-templates

I have also used w3schools throughout the design and I have used as boilerplate code love-running with major modifications.

I have also used the GitHuB markdown manual.

I have to give a shoutout to the link below as it thought me howto do the Goto Top: 
https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/floating-back-to-top-button-in-markdown-documents/71696

I also used for a hidden label on the nav-bar for accessability: https://medium.com/web-accessibility-tips-tricks-and-techniques-for/web-accessibility-tip-visually-hidden-text-for-screen-readers-a52d954d9711
