			<h3>Software Developer/Designer</h3>
			<h4>Michael Cloran Sole Trader</h4>
			<h4>Apr 13 -> Jul 13 Remote</h4>
			<p>I worked on a Graphical user interface driven Ideal Photonic Logic Simulator. 
			This is an educational tool in order to allow a user to explore Photonic Hardware algorithms for large and complex systems. 
			Note the scripting is at a high level and not used for component design thus it is similar to electronic binary but in the optical domain. 
			Thus this software introduces my approach to decimal and binary in the optical domain.</p>
