 ### Contact page

  - The Contact page is to be used as a avenue for a possability to contact Michael Cloran. It is not server side ready just yet
    so when the user clicks on submit the form it redirects to a form submitted page which acknowledges the submission of the form and tells the user
    that they will be redirected to the Home page in 10 seconds. It also has the ability to manually link to the home page via a link. Note that all form fields are required
    for the form to submit.

### validation of code

## Deployment
The site was Deployed to GitHub.

This was done by logging into GitHub, then choosing a repository michael-cloran then navigating to settings on the menu
bar and then clicking on settings. Then on clicking pages on the sidebar and then on Build and deployment clicking on 
Deploy from branch and for branch choosing main and root and then clicking on save. Once this is done the website will be deployed
and after a few minutes it will be live on for instance : https://michaelcloran.github.io/michael-cloran/
