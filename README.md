Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!

  <br>

  <br>
  ### Contact page

  - The Contact page is to be used as a avenue for a possability to contact Michael Cloran. It is not server side ready just yet
    so when the user clicks on submit the form reads back the contents of the message. Note that the all form fields are required
    for the form to submit.

  ## Testing
    On Google Chrome and Firefox it is possible to test the code on different virtual devices. The screen grab below
    shows the website on the IPhone SE. I have with this tool tested the website on all devices present in Google Chrome
    and got reasonably good results.<br>

    <br>

    ### validation of code
    * I have used the HTML validator: https://validator.w3.org and all went well for all html files
    * I have also used the CSS validator: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator and all went well on the styles

## Deployment
The site was Deployed to GitHub.

THis was done by logging into GitHub, then choosing a repository michael-cloran then navigating to settings on the menu
bar and then clicking on settings. Then on clicking pages on the sidebar and then on Build and deployment clicking on 
Deploy from branch and for branch choosing main and root and then clicking on save. Once this is done the website will be deployed
and after a few minutes it will be live on for instance : https://michaelcloran.github.io/michael-cloran/
